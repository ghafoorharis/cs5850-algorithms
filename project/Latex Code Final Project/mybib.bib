 abstract={Clustering is the partitioning of a set of objects into groups (clusters) so that objects within a group are more similar to each others than objects in different groups. Most of the clustering algorithms depend on some assumptions in order to define the subgroups present in a data set. As a consequence, the resulting clustering scheme requires some sort of evaluation as regards its validity. The evaluation procedure has to tackle difficult problems such as the quality of clusters, the degree with which a clustering scheme fits a specific data set and the optimal number of clusters in a partitioning. In the literature, a wide variety of indices have been proposed to find the optimal number of clusters in a partitioning of a data set during the clustering process. However, for most of indices proposed in the literature, programs are unavailable to test these indices and compare them. The R package NbClust has been developed for that purpose. It provides 30 indices which determine the number of clusters in a data set and it offers also the best clustering scheme from different results to the user. In addition, it provides a function to perform k-means and hierarchical clustering with different distance measures and aggregation methods. Any combination of validation indices and clustering methods can be requested in a single function call. This enables the user to simultaneously evaluate several clustering schemes while varying the number of clusters, to help determining the most appropriate number of clusters for the data set of interest.},

ABSTRACT = {The last few decades have been characterised by a very active application of smart technologies in various fields of industry. This paper deals with industrial activities, such as injection molding, where it is required to monitor continuously the manufacturing process to identify both the effective running time and down-time periods. Supervised machine learning algorithms are developed to recognize automatically the periods of the injection molding machines. The former algorithm uses directly the features of the descriptive statistics, while the latter one utilizes a convolutional neural network. The automatic state recognition system is equipped with an 3D-accelerometer sensor whose datasets are used to train and verify the proposed algorithms. The novelty of our contribution is that accelerometer data-based machine learning models are used to distinguish producing and non-producing periods by means of recognition of key steps in an injection molding cycle. The first testing results show the approximate overall balanced accuracy of 72–92% that illustrates the large potential of the monitoring system with the accelerometer. According to the ANOVA test, there are no sufficient statistical differences between the comparative algorithms, but the results of the neural network exhibit higher variances of the defined accuracy metrics.},
